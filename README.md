<h1 align= "center"> LangTranslation</h1>


Sometimes, when using the mobile device, user might come across texts in different language. 
Then he might copy the text and make use of some translator to get it translated to  the required language. 
Providing the user with an option, which he can use to get the other language text context in the mobile screen translated to his  device language might be helpful.


Goal of the project can be divided into two sections.
First, user should be provided with a floating ‚Äòtranslation‚Äô option in the device, when some other language content is detected. 
Second, when the user touches the floating point option, the text contents in the current screen should be translated to the user‚Äôs language and displayed.
